The number of people traveling abroad in China had tripled within 10 years. This is due to the relaxation of issuing tourists visa to Chinese. Germany and Hong Kong fluctuate in the second and third places.</h4>

The UK, Poland, Hong Kong, and Germany tourists number is higher than the population number, which means these countries' outbound travel times per capita is over 1.</h4>

Poles and Hong Kong people spent much less than the other countries, recalling the result of the previous plot: these two countries per capita travel time is very high, so we can conclude that people in these two countries have many short-distance trips.</h4>
